<!--
  This is a simple example / template impress.js slide show. The goal is to be
  easier to read for a first timer than the official and very feature rich
  demo by bartaz (http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/). It's also a very
  traditional presentation that looks like slides (square screens with bullet
  points...), again to make a first timer feel more at home. From this simple
  presentation you can then go on to more powerful impress.js presentations!
  
  This example is hopefully helpful for people that want to create both
  simple and (eventually) awesome presentations in impress.js and comfortable
  doing that directly in HTML.

        So you've designed your mass cytometry panel and realized that Fluidigm doesn't offer conjugated antibodies for several of your specific markers. That's where the conjugation service comes in. We can conjugate any antibody to any of the lanthanide metals. We use the MaxPar kits from Fluidigm and keep all of the metals in stock so we can conjugate your antibodies whenever you need.

        BSA is commonly used as a carrier protein in antibody formulations. 
        <ul>
            <li>It helps stabilize the antibody making it last longer in the fridge.</li>
        </ul>
        BUT BSA is a major problem when conjugating antibodies.
    </ul>
        <li> BSA has >33 disulphide bridges</li>
        <li>IgG has between 3 and 6 disulphide bridges available for conjugation</li>
        <li>BSA will conjugate the linker-lanthanide molecule 10x more than IgG</li>
        <li>This results in very poor conjugation efficiencies</li>

                Sometimes BSA-free formulations are either unavailable or prohibitively expensive. All is not lost. There are BSA-removal kits available from a number of vendors. We have had success with the abcam Gold BSA removal kit and the Pierce Antibody Clean-up kit.</div>

        <div id = grey-box class = grey-box style = "font-size: 18pt;">
            We can stretch the analogy a little further to make one more point - In the same way we wouldn't plan a seating chart with gaps at the head of the table (just in case someone shows up), we shouldn't leave gaps in our panel design. It is much better to design a large panel now and not use all of it for initial studies than to design a small panel now and hope to expand it further down the line.

           <p> Once you've mastered  and optimized sample preparation you can stain your samples. If you're unfamiliar with cytometry techniques, a typical staining workflow consists of:</p><br>

<p>Single cell suspension → Surface Staining → Fixation → Permeabilization →  Intracellular Staining</p><br>

<p>In mass cytometry fixation is always done with 1.6%-4% PFA. All samples must be fixed in mass cytometry experiments.  Permeabilaization reagents vary depending on the targets being stained  and can range from Methanol to Saponin to Tween-20 or Triton-X.</p>
