<!--
  This is a simple example / template impress.js slide show. The goal is to be
  easier to read for a first timer than the official and very feature rich
  demo by bartaz (http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/). It's also a very
  traditional presentation that looks like slides (square screens with bullet
  points...), again to make a first timer feel more at home. From this simple
  presentation you can then go on to more powerful impress.js presentations!
  
  This example is hopefully helpful for people that want to create both
  simple and (eventually) awesome presentations in impress.js and comfortable
  doing that directly in HTML.

        So you've designed your mass cytometry panel and 
        realized that Fluidigm doesn't offer conjugated 
        antibodies for several of your specific markers. 
        That's where the conjugation service comes in. 
        <br><br>
        We can conjugate any antibody to any of the lanthanide metals.
        We use the MaxPar kits from Fluidigm and keep all of the metals 
        in stock so we can conjugate your antibodies whenever you need.

            BSA-free antibodies, please!

        <p>
            BSA is commonly used as a carrier protein 
            in antibody formulations. 
            <ul>
                <li>It helps stabilize the antibody making it last longer in the fridge.</li>
                <li>It's cheap and compatible with staining media</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            BUT BSA is a major problem when conjugating antibodies.
            <ul>
                <li>BSA has >33 disulphide bridges</li>
                <li>IgG has between 3 and 6 disulphide bridges available for conjugation</li>
                <li>BSA will conjugate the linker-lanthanide molecule 10x more than IgG</li>
                <li>This results in very poor conjugation efficiencies</li>
            </ul>   
            <strong>It's very important to purchase antibodies that are carrier free</strong>
