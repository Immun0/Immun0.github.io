  This is a simple example / template impress.js slide show. The goal is to be
  easier to read for a first timer than the official and very feature rich
  demo by bartaz (http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/). It's also a very
  traditional presentation that looks like slides (square screens with bullet
  points...), again to make a first timer feel more at home. From this simple
  presentation you can then go on to more powerful impress.js presentations!
  
  This example is hopefully helpful for people that want to create both
  simple and (eventually) awesome presentations in impress.js and comfortable
  doing that directly in HTML.

        If you're interested in what's involved in planning a mass cytometry project or are planning a project for yourself, then you've come to the right place. Here, we'll spell out the may things you should think about when planning your project. A little planning will let you reap the highest rewards.

        <body> A mass cytometry project workflow consists of:
        <ol style = "text-align: center;list-style-position: inside;">

    <br>
        <div id = "grey-box" class = "grey-box">
            It's is very important  that you have a clear scientific question in mind. 
            This question defines the markers we need to analyze, which defines your panel. 
            40-50 parameters are a lot in cytometry terms but relatively small compared to other 
            -omics platforms. Without a clear question in mind it's very easy to acquire precious 
            samples and realize we haven't measured everything we needed. We need to use each and 
            every marker to drill down on your specific question.
        </div>

        <h1>Panel Design</h1>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id = "blue-box">
            Panel design is the process of pairing up your markers of interest 
            with the instrument's channels. We do this so that when we acquire your samples, 
            we attain the highest resolution and lowest background possible. 
    </div>
</br>
     <div id = blue-box>
                When designing your panel:
        <ul>
            <li>Assign the most important markers to the most sensitive channels</li>
            <li>Assign highly expressed markers to the least sensitive channels</li>
            <li>Ensure markers expressed on the same cell are not neighbours</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
               <div id= blue-box class = blue-box style = "font-size: 18pt;">
        Panel Design is analogous to planning 
        the seating chart for a dinner party or wedding. 
        We want our most important guests at the head of the 
        table where they can be seen and heard easily. We want our 
        brash loud uncles further down the table out of the way of quieter guests (-people will be able to hear him anyway no matter where we seat him).
        We also want to avoid clashes (maybe we seat the in-laws apart).

        <div id= grey-box >
            <h1 style = "font-size: 24pt;">Design a big panel at the start!</h1>
        </div>
        
        <div id = grey-box class = grey-box style = "font-size: 18pt;">
            We can stretch the analogy a little further to make one more point - In the same way we wouldn't plan a seating chart with gaps at the head of the table (just in case someone shows up), we shouldn't leave gaps in our panel design. It is much better to design a large panel now and not use all of it for initial studies than to design a small panel now and hope to expand it further down the line.

            from other vendors (your usual antibody vendors will be fine). Purchasing antibodies for conjugation they should be: </p>
            <ul style = "font-size: 14pt;">
                <li> Carrier-Free</li>
                <li> IgG</li>

            At least a few of your markers may never have been used in mass cytometry before (or at least not on the cells and tissues that you are using). It's very important to spend some time validating your antibodies for specificity and titrating ALL of your antibodies

            <p style = "font-size: 16pt"> As important as your panel design is, getting your sample preparation right. Optimizing your sample preparation  helps immeasurably downstream steps like staining and acquisition.
Your aim is to:

        </div>
        <div id = blue-box>
           <p> Once you've mastered  and optimized sample preparation you can stain your samples. If you're unfamiliar with cytometry techniques, a typical staining workflow consists of:</p><br>

<p>Single cell suspension → Surface Staining → Fixation → Permeabilization →  Intracellular Staining</p><br>

<p>In mass cytometry fixation is always done with 1.6%-4% PFA. All samples must be fixed in mass cytometry experiments.  Permeabilaization reagents vary depending on the targets being stained  and can range from Methanol to Saponin to Tween-20 or Triton-X.</p>

        <ul style = "font-size: 16pt;">
        <li> 500 events / second acquisition rate </li>

        <div id = blue-box style = "font-size: 16pt;">
           <p> For mass cytometry we rarely use manual gating techniques. Most often we use high parameter workflows consisting of:
