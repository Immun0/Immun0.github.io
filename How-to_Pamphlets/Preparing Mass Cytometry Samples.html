<!--
  This is a simple example / template impress.js slide show. The goal is to be
  easier to read for a first timer than the official and very feature rich
  demo by bartaz (http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/). It's also a very
  traditional presentation that looks like slides (square screens with bullet
  points...), again to make a first timer feel more at home. From this simple
  presentation you can then go on to more powerful impress.js presentations!
  
  This example is hopefully helpful for people that want to create both
  simple and (eventually) awesome presentations in impress.js and comfortable
  doing that directly in HTML.

        <p>
            If you're just starting out we recommend that you start with samples in the 2-3 million cell range. Sample preparation and staining can be quite harsh on cells, especially when you're learning. Cells are normally washed (centrifuged) multiple times, fixed and permeabilized with either detergents or alcohols. All of these treatments can lead to significant cell loss, so while you're learning it's better to use a larger sample to optimize your protocols. Don't worry. We can acquire samples as small as 25-50,000 cells but while you're optimizing your protocol, it's better to go big!

            <p>
                Lead is used in glass manufacture. It can leech into any cells, buffers or media that have been stored in glass bottles and remains a contaminant in those cells for a long period of time.  It's important to avoid any glassware in your sample preparation protocols.

            Barium is found primarily found in dishwashing powders. It contaminates any glass- or plastic-ware washed in the glass-wash. It's vital to avoid using any glass-washed labware in your sample preparation. Ideally, you should use dispoasble plastics for every step of your assay.    </p>

            Iodine-containig compounds are an important component of centrifuge density gradients. It's crucial when using these gradients to be very careful when extracting the cell layer after centrifugation.

            <p> Mass cytometry analyses single cells. Cell doublets and debris confound analyses.
                A typical staining protocol for mass cytometry is:
                Single cell suspension → Surface Staining → Fixation → Permeabilization → Intracellular Staining.
                Generating a single cell suspension is the very first step in this process. If you make a good single cell suspension, it sets up  your workflow. If you make a poor single cell suspension, it doesn't matter how well you perform subsequent steps, you'll have problems.

            <p> Mechanical disaggregation, with a cell scraper for cell lines or with surgical tools for solid organs can be sufficient to generate a single suspension (e.g. thymus and spleen).
