<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
<p>Staining samples in a unique way so that they can be identified  for analysis even when mixed with other samples</p>
<ul>
<li>Bar-coding allows us to multiplex - mix our samples together.</li>
<li>Stain and acquire ALL samples simultaneously</li>
<li>BUT still analyze each sample individually.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-barcode">Why BARCODE?</h2>
<ul><li><p>Make work-flows more efficient</p>
<ul>
<li>Stain and process one large sample
<ul>
<li>Can reduce acquisition time</li>
<li>Can reduce cell loss</li>
<li>Can reduce antibody requirements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improve data consistency
<ul>
<li>By staining and processing all lour samples together
<ul>
<li>minimise batch effects</li>
<li>eliminate pipetting errors</li>
<li>Eliminates carryover from sample to sample</li>
<li>Provides additional and improved doublet discrimination</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enables scaled-up experiments
<ul>
<li>Reduces sample processing time</li>

<p>All of the benefits do not come for &ldquo;free&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&quot;While barcoding of samples has many benefits, it represents an additional step in the protocol, needs to be optimised on into own, and usually occupies cytometry channels which would otherwise be available to the measurement of target analytes.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Cossarizza et al. <em>European Journal of Immunology, 47 (2017) 1584-1797</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Integrating bar-codes into existing panels</p>
<ul>
<li>Bar-coding reagents occupy the same channels as our targets</li>
<li>Bar-coding can have specific requirements like fixed cells</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Limited number of barcodes to use at a time</p>
<ul>
<li>12-20 barcodes</li>
<li>Fluorochrome selection</li>
<li>Instrument capability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Spillover</p>

<li>Barcoding parameter spillover</li>

<h2 id="how-do-we-do-it">How do we do it?</h2>
<p>Each sample is tagged with a unique identifier. In the case of flow cytometry this is a specific dilutions of one or two fluorescent dyes that react with all cells. For mass cytometry we use several different approaches. We can use Palladium-tagged dyes or dilutions of pan-specific antibodies. In mass cytometry we can often use exclusive channels like the Palladium channels so that we don&rsquo;t reduce the number of phenotypic antibodies we can use.</p>

<h4 id="palladium-bar-codes-for-universal-cell-multiplexing">Palladium Bar-codes for universal cell multiplexing</h4>
<p>Up to 20 samples can be barcoded using a 6 isotope - pick 3 format.
Since Palladium is not traditionally used for antibody staining we don&rsquo;t lose channels when we integrate this kit into our work flow. However, the kit only works only on fixed cells. You can choose when to bar-code though
- At very beginning
- After surface stain
- Just before acquisition</p>
<h4 id="live-cell-cd45-based-bar-coding">Live cell CD45-based bar-coding</h4>
<p>Uses anti-CD45 antibodies and 7 Cadmium and 4 Platinum conjugated antibodies in an 11 choose 3 (165 samples) or 7 choose 3 (35 samples Cadmium Only) format. Can be performed prior to marker staining. Cd45 is insensitive to fixation and allows optimal detection of fixation sensitive epitomes on other markers. The markers used are not traditionally used for target markers so you can still use a large panel. If utilising the platinum channels will need to change live-dead to Rhodium or another marker.</p>
<h4 id="universal-live-cell-barcoding-for-human-samples">Universal live cell barcoding for human samples</h4>
<p>Bend all lab explores ways of barcoding all the samples.</p>
<ul>
<li>Target ubiquitous molecules b2m and CD298</li>
<li>Non lanthanide isotopes used for barcoding leaves all normal phenotyping channels open</li>
<li>Unlike CD45, this approach is lineage independent so can be used for any cell types you need</li>
</ul>
